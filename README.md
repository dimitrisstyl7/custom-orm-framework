## Description
Custom ORM Framework is a lightweight Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) solution for Java that uses annotations and reflection to automatically inject database-related code.
This project aims to demonstrate how ORM and reflection work together by allowing developers to define entities, primary keys, constraints, and queries using Java annotations.

Supported database engines:
- **Apache Derby**
- **SQLite**
- **H2**

## Features
- Define database schemas using Java annotations
- Support for primary keys, unique constraints, and not-null constraints
- Automatic table creation based on class structure
- Query execution for fetching all records (`SELECT *`) via annotation
- Query execution for deleting records by primary key via annotation
- Reflection-based entity processing
- Configurable database connection setup
